Creating React apps    (my sections)
----------------------------------

Notes:

-React uses arrow functions, let and const statements. Might be a good idea
to explain what these are since they're a part of a newer version of javascript.

-React allows for the development of complex UIs using small pieces of isolated
code known as components.

- A react component takes in parameters, called props, and returns a
hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

-The render method returns a description of what you want to see.
This return value is a React element. JSX is the syntax used to write this.
a line such as <div /> is changed at build time to React.createElement('div').

-React takes this description and displays the result.

-Any javascript expression can be placed within the JSX braces. Hence, each
React element is a javascript object that can be stored in a variable.

-Arrow notation. Instead of: onclick = {function() {alert('click');}}
can just do onClick = {() => alert('click')}

-To remember things, components use state. this.state in the constructor
 can be used to give the component a state.

 -Need to call super(props) when defining the constructor of a subclass.
 This includes all react component classes that have a constructor.

-To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components
communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state in their
parent component instead. The parent component can pass the state back
down to the children by using props, keeping them in sync.

-Try and maintain immutability if possible.
  -Complex features become easier to implement, as you can use older data
  rather than just replacing it
  -Can detect changes in the object.
  -Easier to build pure components in react. Can help determine if changes
  have been made.

-Function components
  simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and don't
  have their own state. Function that takes props as input and returns
  what should be rendered.

  ex:
    function Square(props){
      return(
      <button classname ="square" onClick={props.onClick}>
        {props.value}
      </button>
      );
    }
