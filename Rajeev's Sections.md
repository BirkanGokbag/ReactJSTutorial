## Introduction
  React is an extension of the base Javascript functionality to allow for a greater ease in developing user interfaces. This is accomplished by
  using building blocks known as components, passing parameters known as
  props and adjusting a variable known as state that each component
  possesses. By using a render() method, the content displayed by the
  document can be changed. This set of instructions will go over the
  setup required to use React followed by walking through each of
  the various components used to design User Interfaces. Finally, the instructions will go over how to build and deploy a react app.
