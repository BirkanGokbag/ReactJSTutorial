JSX: 
Javascript XML
 Can write what looks what html and create your own xml like tags
  not manditory
   compare JSX and non-JSX EXAMPLE
  under the hood runs createElement
  closer to javascript, instead of HTML, so:
   * className is used instead of class for adding CSS classes, as class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
   * Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase – onclick will become onClick.
   * Self-closing tags must end in a slash – e.g. <img />
  Can include javascript insidse brackets
   See EXAMPLE
 

components: simple and class
 Pretty Much everything in React is a component:
  Everything loads into main App component, and each component usually gets own file
  export component and load it into necessary file
  components can be nested
  *Simple
   is a function, doesn't use class keyword
   gets called to insert jsx into page
   EXAMPLE
  *Class
   uses class key word
   custom class component
    name capitalized to differentiate from built-in html components
   must include render()
   can only return one parent element
