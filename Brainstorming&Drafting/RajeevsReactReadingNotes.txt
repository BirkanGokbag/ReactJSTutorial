Necessary Javascript Links for static html
Creating React apps    (my sections)
----------------------------------

Notes:

-React uses arrow functions, let and const statements. Might be a good idea
to explain what these are since they're a part of a newer version of javascript.

-React allows for the development of complex UIs using small pieces of isolated
code known as components.

- A react component takes in parameters, called props, and returns a
hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

-The render method returns a description of what you want to see.
This return value is a React element. JSX is the syntax used to write this.
a line such as <div /> is changed at build time to React.createElement('div').

-React takes this description and displays the result.

-Any javascript expression can be placed within the JSX braces. Hence, each
React element is a javascript object that can be stored in a variable.

-Arrow notation. Instead of: onclick = {function() {alert('click');}}
can just do onClick = {() => alert('click')}

-To remember things, components use state. this.state in the constructor
 can be used to give the component a state.

 -Need to call super(props) when defining the constructor of a subclass.
 This includes all react component classes that have a constructor.

-To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components
communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state in their
parent component instead. The parent component can pass the state back
down to the children by using props, keeping them in sync.

-Try and maintain immutability if possible.
  -Complex features become easier to implement, as you can use older data
  rather than just replacing it
  -Can detect changes in the object.
  -Easier to build pure components in react. Can help determine if changes
  have been made.

-Function components
  simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and don't
  have their own state. Function that takes props as input and returns
  what should be rendered.

  ex:
    function Square(props){
      return(
      <button classname ="square" onClick={props.onClick}>
        {props.value}
      </button>
      );
    }

Tania Rascia:

Setting up:

Static HTML file:
make a basic index.html fule. Load three CDNs in the head - React,
React DOM and Babel.

Make a div with id root. Create a script tag.
EX:
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <title>Hello React!</title>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.26.0/babel.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

    <div id="root"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
        // React code will go here
    </script>

</body>

</html>


-To create a component, create a class that extends React.Component.

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))

-This is the more messy method. It is less efficient and hard to maintain
----------------------------------------------------------------

-Facebook has created Create React App. This is a preconfigured environment
with everything needed to build a React app.

-Need Node js though. But can create a react project using

npx create-react-app <NAME>

-To start the project
cd <NAME>
npm start


-This will open a new window at localhost:3000 with the new app.

-Editing the file src/App.js at this point will cause the changes to be reflected in this
app.

-Can clear out files in src (except index.css and index.js) and start from
scratch. In index.js need to import React, ReactDom and the css file.

-Can now write javascript code here to render the page.
-EX: App class that extends Component

-ReactDevTools is a potential extension that helps when working with react.


JSX - Javascript XML

Can export components and load them in different files.
Good for organization.

-Simple component: A function. Doesn't use the class keyword. Arrow notation.
function that simply returns what needs to be rendered. Class component has a render function
A simple component does not.

-Properties:
Data passed to components is stored in the virtualDOM
