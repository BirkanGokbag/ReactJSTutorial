Introduction/Setup - Focused primarily on knowledge and understanding. Telling the reader what they need to do and giving an overview of what React is.

componentsJSX - Focused primarily on apply, but also included aspects from remember and understand (explaining what a component is for example). At the application level, showed how to use components in a React project, and provided sample code.

props-state - Included remember and understand while explaining the concepts of props and state. Then focused on apply to teach user how to use props and state in a React program. Also used analyze to connect these applications together.

formsAPI - Used analyze to draw comparisons between HTML and React. Used apply along with understand and remember to first explain the concepts to the user and then show how these concepts are used in a real React project.

Build/Deploy - Used remember to tell the user how to perform the task.
